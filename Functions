Nmap parameters/flags/switches and their functions:

Scan Types (-s)
-sS (TCP SYN scan): Most popular and stealthy. Sends SYN packets without completing the connection
-sT (TCP connect scan): Completes TCP connection. More detectable but doesn't require privileges
-sU (UDP scan): Scans UDP ports (slower)
-sA (ACK scan): Detects firewalls and filtering rules
-sN/-sF/-sX (Null, FIN, Xmas scans): Stealth techniques to evade firewalls
-sV (Version detection): Detects service versions on open ports
-sC (Script scan): Runs default NSE scripts


Host Discovery (-sn, -P)
-sn (Ping scan): Only discovers active hosts, doesn't scan ports
-Pn (No ping): Assumes host is up, useful if it blocks ping
-PS/PA/PU (TCP SYN/ACK/UDP ping): Different ping methods
-PE/PP/PM (ICMP ping): Echo, timestamp, netmask request


Port Specification (-p)
-p 80 (Specific port)
-p 1-100 (Port range)
-p- (All 65535 ports)
-p http,https (By service name)
--top-ports 100 (The 100 most common ports)


Timing and Performance (-T)
-T0 (Paranoid): Extremely slow, for IDS evasion
-T1 (Sneaky): Very slow
-T2 (Polite): Slow, less aggressive with the network
-T3 (Normal): Default speed
-T4 (Aggressive): Faster, assumes reliable network
-T5 (Insane): Extremely fast, may lose accuracy


OS and Service Detection
-O (OS detection): Detects operating system
-A (Aggressive scan): Combines -O, -sV, -sC and traceroute
--osscan-guess: Guesses OS more aggressively


Output (-o)
-oN file.txt (Normal output)
-oX file.xml (XML output)
-oG file.grep (Grepable output)
-oA name (Saves in all 3 formats)
-v/-vv (Verbose): More information during scan


Evasion and Stealth
-f (Fragment packets): Fragments packets to evade firewalls
-D (Decoy): Uses decoy IPs to hide your real IP
-S (Spoof source): Spoofs source IP
--randomize-hosts: Scans targets in random order
--data-length: Adds random data to evade detection


NSE Scripts (--script)
--script vuln: Searches for known vulnerabilities
--script default: Safe and useful scripts
--script auth: Authentication scripts
--script discovery: Discovery scripts


Practical Examples

# Complete and aggressive scan
nmap -A -T4 192.168.1.1

# Stealthy scan of common ports
nmap -sS --top-ports 1000 -T2 192.168.1.1

# Detect services and versions
nmap -sV -p 80,443,8080 192.168.1.1

# Network-wide scan without ports
nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24

# Search for vulnerabilities
nmap --script vuln -p 80,443 192.168.1.1

# Save results
nmap -sS -oA my_scan 192.168.1.1
