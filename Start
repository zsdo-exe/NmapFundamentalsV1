This is the beginning of my version for learning NMAP

First: Install Subversion (svn)

- sudo apt update
- sudo apt install subversion

Verify that it was installed:
- svn --version   (Example svn, version 1.14.x)

Download the Nmap source code

- cd ~
- svn co https://svn.nmap.org/nmap

The command svn co(or svn checkout) downloads the entire repository.

Compile and Install
Once downloaded, go into the folder and compete:

- cd nmap
- ./configure
- make -j4
- sudo make install

BUT WAIT... Do you really need to compile it? 
Kali Linux comes with Nmap already installed and updated.

- y
nmap --version
If you already have Nmap 7.9x+, you do NOT need to compile unless:

You want the latest development version
You want to contribute to the project
You need experimental characteristics
Simply update Nmap using your package manager:

- sudo apt update
- sudo apt upgrade nmap
- nmap --version

Okay, are you ready for the first analysis?

- nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24

Ping scans to see which machines are turned on  
(Nmap scan report for 192.168.1.254 Host is up (0.000017s latency).)
